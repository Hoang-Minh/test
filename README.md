This sandbox project is a part of React-Native-Advanced course by Stephen Grider. That guy did a great job!
Comprehensive, well thought material. Some deps or libs are outdated though :/


The main goal of this repo is to catch up with some JS novelties, refactore the code and make the app usable

What I did so far:
- "react-navigation": "1.0.0-beta.7" ---> "5.x" Big chnages here!
- "redux-persist": "4.6.0", ---> "6.0.0"

TODO:
- React hooks
