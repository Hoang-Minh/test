This sandbox project is a part of React-Native-Advanced course by Stephen Grider. That guy did a great job!
Comprehensive, well thought material. Some deps or libs are outdated though :/


The main goal of this repo is to catch up with some JS novelties, refactore the code and make the app usable

What I did so far:
- React navigation V5
- 

TODO:
- React hooks
